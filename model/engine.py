ONE STEP AT A TIME
------------------
The game is turn-based, so the world is stepped once per request and the
circuit travels back and forth as QASM3 text in the `circuit` field:

    step   apply the world's targets once to the circuit given (or to the
           identity on n qubits when none is), read every qubit's <Z>, and
           return the circuit that resulted.
             enter   {direction, coherence}: widen the circuit first so the
                     player's qubit joins it - see WHAT THE PLAYER'S QUBIT IS
             couple  a holding index: also drive <Z_apparatus Z_holding> to 1
                     this step, which is what a held position does

The player's qubit joins the circuit when they invest and couples from the
step after, so the reading they bought at is the reading they were shown.

`scout` is the old batch run - the whole clean trajectory in one process - and
is kept for the cache warmer and the selftest, which checks that a world
stepped in ten processes is the world stepped in one.

WHAT A WORLD IS
---------------
A *specification*: a set of target expectation values.  A step applies all of
them to the circuit the last step produced.  It would run forever if you let
it; the game decides how many steps a round is.

WHAT THE PLAYER'S QUBIT IS
--------------------------
An apparatus qubit sits outside the specification's qubits, plus a hidden qubit
behind it.  The apparatus is prepared to a carried direction *and length*, and
that length is the whole coherence economy - so it has to survive being handed
back in next round.

QDrive cannot do that on its own: it drives a unitary circuit, so an isolated
single-qubit target can only ever land on the sphere's surface.  So the
apparatus is prepared as an explicit circuit:

    RY(arccos c) on the hidden qubit, then CNOT onto the apparatus
        -> apparatus is mixed on +Z with |r| = c
    RY/RZ on the apparatus
        -> rotates the axis; eigenvalues, hence |r|, are preserved

Coupling then drains it on its own, which is the point: hold a position across
several steps and the apparatus comes back shorter than it went in.

WHERE THE ENGINE COMES FROM
---------------------------
qdrive-api and QDrive are both private and are not vendored here.
MW_QDRIVE_API_SRC points at a qdrive-api clone's src/; requirements.txt says
how QDrive itself is installed.
